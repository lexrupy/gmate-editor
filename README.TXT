GMATE EDITOR
============

This is a DRAFT of a powerfull text editor

I have started writing it to provide some "Textmate" power to linux (and windows) users.
The first aim is to create a solid base extensible with plugins (Bundles).


Currently, I have no time to continue developing this software, so, what you will found here is just a starting point to get a working text editor with some basic features.


WHAT SHOULD BE DONE TO GET THIS EDITOR WORKING?
===============================================

1. Finish to Write the plugins API, and All documentation needed for people to develop plugins.
2. Port some usefull plugins from Gedit, RedCar, jEdit, Scribes and other editors to add:
    * Snippets Support
    * Modelines Support
    * Word Completion
    * More, More More....
3. Write a Good FileManager that supports various encodings.
4. Write a Good search and replace with regular expressions support.
5. Port From RedCar the GtkMateView, so Textmate Syntax Highlighting and Themes could be easily used with gmate.
